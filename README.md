# Supermart-grocery-sales

The Supermart Grocery Sales - Retail Analytics Dataset project is an intermediate-level data analytics initiative designed to analyze and model grocery sales data from a fictional supermarket operating in Tamil Nadu, India. Leveraging tools such as Python, SQL, and Excel, this project involves exploring customer order data, including attributes like categories, subcategories, cities, regions, sales, discounts, and profits. Key objectives include cleaning the dataset by addressing missing values and duplicates, converting dates into meaningful features, and encoding categorical variables. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) uncovers trends in sales by category, city, month, and year, as well as correlations between discounts, profits, and sales. The project also employs machine learning techniques, such as linear regression, to predict sales based on features like product category, city, and discount rates. Through visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps, the project provides actionable insights for optimizing sales strategies. It demonstrates practical data analytics and modeling techniques applicable to retail analytics and inventory planning.
